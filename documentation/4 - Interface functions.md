We propose some alternatives to the already present functions:
```rust  
pub fn put(  
    robot: &mut impl Runnable,  
    world: &mut World,  
    content_in: Content,  
    quantity: usize,  
    direction: Direction,  
) -> Result<usize, LibError>;

pub fn go(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	world: &mut World, 
	direction: Direction
) -> Result<TileMatrix, LibError>;

pub fn destroy(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	world: &mut World, 
	direction: Direction
) -> Result<usize, LibError>;

pub fn craft(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	content: Content
) -> Result<Content, LibError>;

pub fn teleport(  
    robot: &mut impl Runnable,  
    world: &mut World,  
    coordinates: (usize, usize),  
) -> Result<TileMatrix, LibError>;
```

these alternatives are:

```rust  
pub fn put_with_sound(  
    robot: &mut impl Runnable,  
    world: &mut World,  
    content_in: Content,  
    quantity: usize,  
    direction: Direction,  
) -> Result<usize, LibError>;

pub fn go_with_sound(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	world: &mut World, 
	direction: Direction
) -> Result<TileMatrix, LibError>;

pub fn destroy_with_sound(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	world: &mut World, 
	direction: Direction
) -> Result<usize, LibError>;

pub fn craft_with_sound(
	robot: &mut impl Runnable, 
	content: Content
) -> Result<Content, LibError>;

pub fn teleport_with_sound(  
    robot: &mut impl Runnable,  
    world: &mut World,  
    coordinates: (usize, usize),  
) -> Result<TileMatrix, LibError>;
```

they work the same as the original one, exept that they (you wouldn't guess) play the sounds.
